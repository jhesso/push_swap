 building the string thingy

with ./push_swap "1 2 3"
after building stack_a, a contains only 2 and 3. we just completely
skipped 1
missing 1 found :D fixed and removed some unnecessary logic from stack
building, fixed the issue and removed a couple lines of code so win win

with ./push_swap 1 2 3
we just segfault because the string building doesnt work perfectly
